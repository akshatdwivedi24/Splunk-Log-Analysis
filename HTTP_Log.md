Splunk Log Analysis & Dashboarding

üéØ Objective: 

üîπAnalyze and Visualize HTTP log, detect anomalies and unusual traffic.
üîπBuild interactive dashboards for better visibility and insights.

üéØHTTP Log Analysis and Key Queries:


1Ô∏è‚É£ Top Source IPs by HTTP Requests
: Which source IPs generated the most HTTP requests?

```
     index="http_lab" source="http.json" host="GODSPEED" sourcetype="_json"
     | stats count by id.orig_h
     | sort -count

 ```

Aim: Identify the most active clients communicating with the server, helping spot heavy users or potential attackers.



2Ô∏è‚É£ Most Common HTTP Methods
: What HTTP methods are most commonly used?

```
index="http_lab" source="http.json" host="GODSPEED" sourcetype="_json"
| stats count by method
| sort -count

```
<img width="1920" height="871" alt="Screenshot (96)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af8dcdf-0362-45d4-8936-342dbc4006de" />

Aim: Understand which HTTP operations (GET, POST, etc.) dominate the traffic and detect abnormal usage patterns.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Suspicious HTTP Requests
: Which IPs triggered suspicious HTTP activity (sqlmap, curl, botnet, etc.)?
```
index="http_lab" source="http.json" host="GODSPEED" sourcetype="_json" event_type="Suspicious*"
| stats count by id.orig_h, user_agent, uri
| sort -count

```
<img width="1920" height="897" alt="Screenshot (97)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc6bf398-80f2-47e7-aaa9-04f5f73c6f9e" />



4Ô∏è‚É£ Large Data Transfers
: Which IPs were involved in unusually large HTTP responses?

```
index="http_lab" source="http.json" host="GODSPEED" sourcetype="_json" event_type="Large Transfer"
| stats sum(resp_body_len) as total_bytes by id.orig_h, id.resp_h
| sort -total_bytes

```
<img width="1920" height="887" alt="Screenshot (98)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef36d9a6-10f4-4441-8f79-52167480c62e" />

Aim: Identify clients or servers involved in large data transfers, which could signal data exfiltration or heavy file downloads.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Suspicious User Agents
: Which non-browser tools accessed the server?

```
index="http_lab" source="http.json" host="GODSPEED" sourcetype="_json"
| where like(user_agent,"%sqlmap%") OR like(user_agent,"%curl%") OR like(user_agent,"%python%") OR like(user_agent,"%botnet%")
| stats count by user_agent, id.orig_h

```
<img width="1920" height="883" alt="Screenshot (99)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0954f089-1eb0-4b68-8ae2-15dab683c53d" />


6Ô∏è‚É£ Possible Web Shell / Sensitive File Access
: Did any clients attempt to access files like /shell.php or /etc/passwd?



```
index="http_lab" source="http.json" host="GODSPEED" sourcetype="_json"
| search uri="/shell.php" OR uri="/etc/passwd"
| stats count by id.orig_h, uri, user_agent

```
<img width="1920" height="891" alt="Screenshot (100)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b076eae-b4c9-4632-af5b-a09852085ef3" />


Aim: Identify attempts to access critical files that could indicate exploitation or reconnaissance activity.


üîê 10Ô∏è‚É£ Potential Compromise Detection
: Which IPs have a mix of ‚ÄúLarge Transfer‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuspicious Uri‚Äù or ‚ÄúSuspicious Agent‚Äù ‚Äî possibly indicating data exfiltration?

```
index="http_lab" source="http.json" host="GODSPEED" sourcetype="_json"
| stats values(event_type) as activities by id.orig_h
| search activities="Large Transfer" AND (activities="Suspicious Uri" OR activities="Suspicious Agent")

```
<img width="1920" height="880" alt="Screenshot (101)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4079411-12d6-4c10-804a-49dbf00817e1" />


Aim: Detect IPs showing multiple suspicious behaviors, which may indicate a compromise or ongoing data theft.

üß† HTTP Threat Hunting & Analysis Dashboard (Splunk)

This project focuses on building an interactive Splunk dashboard for analyzing HTTP request logs and detecting potential web-based threats such as data exfiltration, suspicious tools, and abnormal HTTP methods.
The dataset used (http.json) contains simulated HTTP events, including standard and suspicious activity.

The goal of this part of the project is to simulate a SOC-style investigation using HTTP traffic data and visualize insights like:

üë®‚Äçüíª Top active source hosts

üì° Large file transfers

‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious user agents (e.g., sqlmap, curl, botnet-checker)

üíæ Sensitive URI access (like /shell.php or /etc/passwd)

üß© HTTP error analysis

‚è±Ô∏è Timeline of events by type

The end result is a Splunk dashboard that enables real-time web threat visibility.
